# Trello-Parser
This repo contains a parser for Trello cards. It generates a **csv file** resuming all the meaningful information of each card.

## Detect hours
If you add in the description of a Trello cards the time you have spent to complete your task a new column will be generated in the resulting csv file.

### Format

Write in your card description the time in this format:

*|Time spent: **2h 20m**|*

No matters what text you write before the double dot, it parses the text after the ":" symbol. Characters "|" at the beginning and at the end are **necessary**.



## Start the program

1) Create a file called "id_board.txt" and insert the id of your board that you want to parse

2)  Create two files "token.txt" and "key.txt" where you insert the key and token generated by Trello to authenticate yourself

3) Put the files in the same directory of the script *parser.py*

4) Run the comand:

- python parser.py --all (take all the trello cards you have in your board)
- python parser.py (take all the cards in your "In progress" list. You must have it)

5) A file called "trello_activities.csv" will be generated at the end of the program
